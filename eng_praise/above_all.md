# Above All

by Michael W. Smith

**Verse 1** \
G           C       D         G \
Above all powers, Above all Kings \
            C          D            G \
Above all nature, and all created things \
            Em         D               C  G/B \
Above all wisdom, and all the ways of man  \
Am              Am/G           D/F#    G \
You were here before the world began
 
**Verse 2** \
          C        D          G \
Above all kingdoms, Above all thrones \
          C            D              G \
Above all wonders this world has ever known \
          Em          D               C   G/Bv
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth \
Am                C                   B7 B \
There's no way to measure what you're worth
 
**Chorus**
G     Am   D             G \
Crucified, laid behind a stone \
G            Am     D          G \
You lived to die, rejected and alone \
        Em   D               C    G/B \
Like a rose, trampled on the ground \
             Am        G/B        C  D \
You took the fall, and thought of me  \
       G \
Above all

**Coda** \
        Em   D               C    G/B \
Like a rose, trampled on the ground \
             Am        G/B        C  D \
You took the fall, and thought of me  \
       G \
Above all
