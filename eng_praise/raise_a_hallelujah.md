# Raise A Hallelujah

by Bethel Music

**Intro** \
C

**Verse 1** \
   C                        F \
I raise a Hallelujah in the presence of my enemies \
   Am                 G \
I raise a Hallelujah louder than the unbelief \
   C                     F \
I raise a Hallelujah, my weapon is a melody \
   Am                 G \
I raise a Hallelujah, heaven comes to fight for me

**Chorus** \
F                     C \
I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm \
Am                               G \
Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar \
F                   C \
Up from the ashes, hope will arise \
Am                     G \
Death is defeated, the King is alive 

**Verse 2** \
   C                      F \
I raise a Hallelujah with everything inside of me \
   Am                G \
I raise a Hallelujah I will watch the darkness flee \
   C                        F \
I raise a Hallelujah in the middle of the mystery \
   Am                 G \
I raise a Hallelujah fear you lost your hold on me
