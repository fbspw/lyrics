# Shout to the Lord

by Chris Tomlin

**Chorus** \
G             Em           C           D \
Shout to the Lord all the earth let us sing \
G         Em       C             D \
Power and majesty praise to the king \
Em                          C                    D     C/D     D \
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name \
G           Em        C             D \
I sing for joy at the work of your hands \
G             Em         C           D \
Forever I'll love you forever I'll stand \
Em                        C                G \
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
 
 
**Verse** \
G         D           Em            D         C \
 My Jesus, My Savior, Lord there is none like you \
           G                Em                        F   F6 C \
All of my days, I want to praise, the wonders of your mighty love \
G           D            Em        D            C
 My comfort, My shelter, tower of refuge and strength \

Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you
